##Homework -  Teddit with Hashes: Phase 1 
========

###1 - Create Arrays & Hashes

* Copy your solution from ex_teddit_conditional.rb that you completed during the class lab time 
* Create an empty stories array. This will be used to hold all stories we capture.
* Users enter the story as they do now, but it gets put in a hash instead. 
* Update any reference to the story (upvotes, category and title) 

* RESULT your story hash should look something like this:
  * ```{ title: "Monkeys thank mayor for flounder tooth necklace", category: "Teeth", upvotes: 1 }```


###2 - Add Hash to An Array 
* Add the hash to an array called stories
* Print ```"Story: Monkeys thank mayor for flounder tooth necklace, Category: (Teeth), Current Upvotes: 1"```
* Using the stories array, Test your category upvote logic


###2 - Add Loop Logic
* Use a loop, so that your program continues to ask a user for stories until they choose to quit. 
    * "# - e.g. ("Would you like to add another story? Enter 'y' or 'n'")"
* Once the user is finished with entering their stories, use .each to print each story in the stories array.
